# Hello World, I'm Sai Ancha 👋


From the flight paths of aeronautics to the cloud paths of AWS, my journey has been anything but conventional. I'm a Cloud Security Engineer with an unexpected affection for code and a master's degree in Information Assurance.


## My Journey 🛤️
- 🛩️ Once an Aeronautical Engineer, I found my true calling in the cloud, not the skies.
- 👨‍💻 Coding was once my adversary; now, we're allies thanks to intuitive tools and AI companions which increases my productivity.
- 🎓 Master's in Information Assurance led me to the vast and ever-evolving field of Cloud Security.
  
## My Interests 🤖
- 🏡 A simple fascination with smart plugs sparked a full-blown passion for smart home automation.
- 🎛️ From smart sprinklers to security cameras, my home is a symphony of interconnected devices, all harmonized through code.
- 📰 I consume the latest in tech and security through prolific reading on Medium and watching innovators on YouTube.
- 📺 Attuned to the pulse of innovation by following expos like CES, I stay at the cutting edge of smart home tech.
